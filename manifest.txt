since you can't comment in a manifest file I'll do it here

{
    "manifest_version": 3,                             //delcare the version of the chrome extension we're building
    "name": "mochi pet",                                 //give the extension a name

    "version": "0.6.9",                                //version of the chrome extension (in this case 0.6.9 because the chrome extension isn't ready to be published )
    
    "content_scripts":[{                               //inject these files into the web page (these files will directly talk to the webpage)
        "matches": ["<all_urls>"],                     //uploads content scripts to 'all_urls' (meaning every website the google chrome allows you to access) (based on host_permissions)

    }],
    "permissions": [                                   //what the chrome extension has access too and what it's allowed to do

    ],
